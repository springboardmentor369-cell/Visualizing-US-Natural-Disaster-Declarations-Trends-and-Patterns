# Week 5: Visualizations and Data Modeling in Power BI
This week helped me understand how cleaned and analyzed data is finally presented in a visual form that supports decision-making. 

I also learned that effective dashboards are not just about design, but about understanding the type of data and structuring it properly before creating visuals.
## Understanding Dataset Types
At the beginning of the week, we learned about three main types of datasets, which play a key role in deciding which visualization should be used.
* Numerical Data: Data that can be measured or calculated, such as sales, revenue, quantity, or profit.
* Categorical Data: Data that represents categories or groups, such as product type, region, or customer segment.
* Time-Based Data: Data that is related to time intervals, such as dates, months, or years.
  
Understanding these dataset types helped me realize that choosing the wrong visual can lead to confusion or misinterpretation of data.
## Importance of Visualizations
This week helped me understand the importance of visualizations in Power BI. Visuals help convert complex data into easy-to-understand insights. I learned that good visualizations:
* Highlight trends and patterns
* Make comparisons easier
* Support faster and better decision-making
## Common Visualizations Learned
### Bar Chart
I learned that bar charts are best used to compare values across different categories. They are simple, clear, and effective for comparison.
### Pie Chart
Pie charts are used to show proportions or percentage distribution of a whole. I learned that they should be used only when there are limited categories to avoid confusion.
### Line Chart
Line charts are mainly used for time-based data. They help in understanding trends, growth, or decline over a period of time.
## Introduction to Data Modeling
After visualizations, we were introduced to data modeling, which is very important when working with large datasets. I learned that data modeling defines how different tables are connected within Power BI, and without proper modeling, reports may give incorrect results.
## Understanding Keys
We learned about:
* Primary Key, which uniquely identifies records in a table
* Secondary (Foreign) Key, which connects one table to another
This helped me understand how tables are linked and how data flows between them.
## Fact Table and Dimension Table
I learned the difference between:
* Fact Table, which contains numerical and measurable data such as sales or quantity
* Dimension Table, which contains descriptive information like product, customer, or time
This concept helped me understand how large datasets are organized efficiently.
## Understanding Relationships Between Tables
We learned why relationships are important in data modeling and how they ensure accurate analysis. The different types of relationships we studied were:
* One-to-Many
* Many-to-One
* One-to-One
* Many-to-Many
Choosing the correct relationship type is essential for correct results in dashboards.
## Understanding Star Schema
Finally, we learned about the star schema, where the fact table is placed at the center and dimension tables are connected around it. I understood that this structure improves performance, clarity, and accuracy in Power BI reports.
## Key Learnings from Week 5
* I learned that understanding dataset types is necessary before creating visualizations.
* I understood how different visuals represent data in different ways.
* I learned that data modeling is the foundation of accurate dashboards.
