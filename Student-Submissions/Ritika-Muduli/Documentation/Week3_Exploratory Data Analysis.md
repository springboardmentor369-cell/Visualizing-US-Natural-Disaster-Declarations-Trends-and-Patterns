# Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which helped me understand how to study data before jumping into conclusions or visualizations. This week changed the way I look at data. Instead of only cleaning it, I learned how to ask questions, identify patterns, and understand the story hidden inside the dataset. EDA made me realize that data analysis is not just technical work but also involves business thinking
## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing a dataset to understand its structure, patterns, trends, and relationships. The main goal of EDA is to become familiar with the data and identify useful insights before applying advanced analysis or building dashboards.

Through this, I learned that EDA helps in:
* Understanding what the data is about
* Identifying errors or unusual values
* Finding patterns and trends
* Asking the right business-related questions
## Steps of EDA Learned
### 1. Checking Volume and Structure of Data
The first step I learned was to understand the volume and structure of the dataset. This included checking:
* How many rows and columns are present
* Which columns are useful and which are not
* How large the dataset is
This step helped me decide what to focus on and what can be ignored, especially from a business point of view.
### 2. Understanding Data Distribution and Identifying Outliers
I learned how to study the distribution of data to understand how values are spread. This helped me identify:
* Common value ranges
* Extreme values or outliers
* Outliers can sometimes indicate errors or special cases, so identifying them is important for accurate analysis.
### 3. Comparing Metrics
Another important learning was comparing two or more columns using a single metric. This helped in:
* Comparing performance across categories
* Understanding differences between groups
This step showed me how comparisons help in evaluating performance and trends.
### 4. Identifying Relationships Between Variables
I learned how to identify relationships between variables, both direct and indirect. For example, understanding how an increase in price may lead to a drop in sales, or how changes in one factor can impact another.

This helped me understand cause-and-effect relationships and how data supports business decisions.
## Practical Work on Netflix Dataset
To apply these concepts, sir gave us a Netflix dataset. Before analysis, we were asked to clean the data properly. After cleaning, we had to identify five meaningful questions that could be answered using the dataset.
This activity helped me:
* Think beyond numbers and focus on insights
* Approach data from a business perspective
* Understand how companies use data to make decisions
## Learning from a Business Perspective
This week helped me shift my thinking from a technical approach to a business-oriented mindset. I learned that EDA is not about finding random patterns, but about answering questions that matter to the business.
## Key Learnings from Week 3
* EDA helps understand data before analysis
