2. Project Description   
  This project focuses on analyzing the most affected states in the United States using FEMA disaster declaration data.  
  Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to identify high-impact regions, compare disaster trends over time, and understand the distribution of disaster types across states.  
  Advanced DAX measures were used to calculate KPIs such as most affected state, average disasters per state, growth percentage, and disaster trends.  
  The dashboard also includes maps, slicers, and time-series visualizations to enable dynamic analysis and better decision-making insights.

## 📌 Internship Experience 
During my internship, I worked on real-world datasets to develop interactive dashboards and extract meaningful insights using Power BI.  
I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, creating relationships between tables, writing DAX formulas, and designing professional dashboards for analytical reporting.  
The internship helped me improve my problem-solving skills, data interpretation abilities, and understanding of business-focused data visualization techniques.  
It also strengthened my ability to communicate insights effectively through visuals and reports.
