## 📌 Internship Experience 

During my data analytics learning journey, I worked on real-world datasets to perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. I gained hands-on experience in building interactive Power BI dashboards, identifying trends through exploratory data analysis, and presenting insights clearly using charts, maps, slicers, and KPI cards.

Through these projects, I improved my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to convert raw data into meaningful insights for decision-making.
