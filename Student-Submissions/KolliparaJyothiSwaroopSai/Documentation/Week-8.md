📘 Week 8 – Dashboard Review, Validation & Improvement Suggestions

This week focused on reviewing the developed dashboards, validating whether they answer the intended analytical questions, and identifying design and insight-level improvements.

The emphasis was on quality, clarity, and decision-readiness, rather than adding more visuals.

🔹 1️⃣ Importance of Dashboard Review

Dashboard review ensures that:

The dashboard answers the intended business question

Visuals are not misleading

KPIs and charts are aligned with insights

Design is clean and professional

📌 A reviewed dashboard moves from “good-looking” to “decision-ready.”

🔹 2️⃣ Validating Dashboard Purpose

Each dashboard must answer one clear question.

Validation Checklist:

Can the user understand the dashboard in 10 seconds?

Are the KPIs aligned with the main question?

Does every visual add value?

Are unnecessary visuals removed?

📌 If a visual does not support the question, it should be removed.

🔹 3️⃣ Review of Dashboard 1 – Regional Disaster Risk & Funding Priority
Core Question:

Which states should be prioritized for disaster preparedness and mitigation?

Review Observations:

KPI cards clearly summarize national disaster exposure

High-risk states are correctly identified using national averages

Bar chart effectively ranks states by disaster frequency

Map supports spatial understanding of risk concentration

Suggestions Implemented:

Added High Risk States KPI for clearer prioritization

Applied consistent color logic (Red = High Risk, Blue = Normal)

Removed unnecessary time-based visuals to maintain focus

📌 Result:
Dashboard 1 is action-oriented and suitable for funding and resource allocation decisions.

🔹 4️⃣ Review of Dashboard 2 – Disaster Trend & National Risk Analysis
Core Question:

How has disaster risk evolved over time, and what does this imply for future preparedness?

Review Observations:

Trend chart clearly shows long-term behavior and peak events

Peak year is highlighted to represent worst-case scenarios

Decade-wise aggregation reduces year-to-year noise

KPIs provide historical context and planning benchmarks

Suggestions Implemented:

Highlighted peak year value using color differentiation

Adjusted background to neutral tones for better readability

Ensured visuals focus on trends rather than geographic details

📌 Result:
Dashboard 2 supports strategic planning and long-term risk assessment.

🔹 5️⃣ Visual & Design Review
Key Design Checks:

Neutral background colors used for readability

KPI cards have consistent styling and spacing

Color meanings are consistent across visuals

Titles are clear and descriptive

📌 Design choices were reviewed to ensure visuals enhance insight, not distract.

🔹 6️⃣ Insight & Storytelling Review

During review, emphasis was placed on:

Clearly communicating what the data shows

Explaining why it matters

Suggesting what actions can be taken

Small insight text boxes were added where needed to support storytelling.

🔹 7️⃣ Final Optimization Decisions

Instead of adding more visuals:

Redundant elements were removed

Layout spacing was improved

Visual hierarchy was refined

📌 This improved dashboard clarity and user experience.

🔹 8️⃣ Lessons Learned from Dashboard Review

Fewer, focused visuals are more effective than many charts

Clear questions lead to better dashboard design

Color consistency improves interpretability

Review and iteration are critical for professional dashboards
