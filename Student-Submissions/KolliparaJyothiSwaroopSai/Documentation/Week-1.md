📅 Week 1: Data Cleaning Using Power BI

Imported the raw FEMA disaster declaration dataset into Power BI Desktop.

Reviewed all columns to understand their meaning, structure, and relevance.

Checked for missing values using Power BI’s data profiling features.

Identified missing values in incident end date and retained them since many disasters are ongoing or occur for a single day.

Removed non-analytical identifier columns that do not contribute to insights.

Verified and corrected data types:

Date fields set as date

Numeric indicators set as numbers

Categorical fields (state, disaster type) set as text

Ensured column names were readable and consistent.

Performed basic filtering to remove irrelevant or duplicate records.

Prepared a clean and structured dataset suitable for further analysis.

Established a strong foundation for deeper cleaning and EDA in Python.
