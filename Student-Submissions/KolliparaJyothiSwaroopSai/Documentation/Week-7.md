📘 Week 7 – Visualizations, KPIs & Dashboard Design (Power BI)

This week focused on how to visually communicate insights effectively using Power BI.
The emphasis was not only on creating visuals, but on designing dashboards that answer business questions clearly and professionally.

🔹 1️⃣ Importance of Visualizations

Visualizations help convert raw data into meaningful insights that are easy to understand.

We use visualizations to:

Identify patterns and trends

Compare values across categories

Highlight risks and priorities

Support faster decision-making

📌 A good visualization answers “What does this mean?”, not just “What is the value?”.

🔹 2️⃣ Types of Visualizations & Their Use Cases

Each chart type has a specific purpose:

Bar / Column Charts
Used for comparisons (e.g., Top States by Disasters)

Line / Area Charts
Used for time-based trends (e.g., Year-wise Disaster Declarations)

Cards (KPIs)
Used to show key summary metrics (e.g., Total Declarations, Peak Year)

Maps
Used for geographical distribution (e.g., State-wise disaster spread)

Donut / Pie Charts
Used to show proportion (e.g., Disaster Type Share)

📌 Choosing the right chart is more important than adding many charts.

🔹 3️⃣ KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

KPIs represent high-level metrics that summarize the state of a business problem.

Examples of KPIs:

Total Disaster Declarations

High Risk States Count

Peak Year Declarations

Average Annual Declarations

Why KPIs are important:

Provide instant insights at a glance

Reduce cognitive load

Help executives focus on what matters most

📌 KPIs should always be:
✔ Clear
✔ Relevant
✔ Minimal

🔹 4️⃣ Background Colours in Dashboards 🎨

Background colors play a crucial role in readability and professionalism.

Best Practices:

Use neutral backgrounds (light grey / off-white)

Avoid strong or bright colors for the canvas

Let data carry the color, not the background

Recommended Background Colors:

Light Grey: #F2F4F8

Off White: #FAFAFA

❌ Avoid:

Red or pink backgrounds (indicates risk)

Dark backgrounds (reduce readability)

🔹 5️⃣ Color Alignment & Visual Consistency

Colors should be used intentionally, not decoratively.

Standard Color Logic:

🔴 Red → High risk / Alert

🔵 Blue → Normal / Neutral

🟢 Green → Positive / Safe

⚪ Grey → Supporting or background elements

📌 Use the same color meaning across all visuals to avoid confusion.

Example:

High-risk states → Red in bar chart & map

Normal states → Blue everywhere

🔹 6️⃣ Title Importance in Dashboards

Titles guide users on what the dashboard or visual represents.

Good Title Characteristics:

Clear

Question-oriented or insight-oriented

Avoids technical jargon

Examples:

❌ “Sheet 1”
❌ “Chart Showing Data”

✅ “Regional Disaster Risk & Funding Priority”
✅ “Annual Disaster Declarations Trend (1953–2025)”

📌 A good title sets context before interpretation.

🔹 7️⃣ Dashboard Structure (Levels Approach)

Effective dashboards follow a top-down information hierarchy.

Level 1 – Overview (Top)

KPI Cards

Summary metrics

Immediate insights

Level 2 – Analysis (Middle)

Trends

Comparisons

Rankings

Level 3 – Details (Bottom)

Maps

Breakdowns

Supporting visuals

📌 This structure ensures:

Faster understanding

Logical flow

Executive-friendly design

🔹 8️⃣ Purpose-Driven Dashboard Design

Every dashboard should answer one core question.

Examples:

Dashboard 1:
Which states should be prioritized for disaster preparedness?

Dashboard 2:
How has national disaster risk evolved over time?

📌 Avoid mixing too many questions in one dashboard.

✅ Week 7 Summary

In Week 7, we learned:

Importance of choosing the right visualizations

Role of KPIs in summarizing business insights

Effective use of background colors and color psychology

Importance of clear and meaningful titles

Structuring dashboards using a layered (levels) approach

Designing dashboards based on questions, not just data

This week helped us understand that good dashboards are not about complexity, but about clarity, consistency, and decision support.
